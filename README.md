# Auto-CTM
Auto CTM is a python script that can create custom terrain with perlin noise right now this is just for fun and has issues 

# Needed
A copy of minecraft bedrock edition is needed (could be converted to java by changing a few lines but no support will be given for java)
python 3.7 MINIMUM recommended is python 3.10

# Setup
1. Download the .py file from thr release tab
2. Install with pip perlin-noise and amulet with `pip install perlin-noise` and `pip install amulet-core`
3. Read Down

# Using
1. Launch The Script And Paste In Your World Location It Will Look Something like `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\minecraftWorlds\WORLDID`
2. Give the script a scale ie 128,256,512,1024,2048,4096,8192 and so on
3. Give it a base Octave (1 too 2 is recomended for 128 or 256)
4. Leave the world if you are in it
5. If any errors show up just wait 
6. Once done load world

# Issues
### 1. ITS TAKING TO LONG  
  If its taking to long for your liking change the scale 
### 2. ALL MY WORLD IS GONE  
  This script replaces chunks in your world so make a new one or risk loosing your world
### 3. My world wont load  
  Sometimes this script will error and break your world
  
# Plans
1. Some Sort Of 3d And 2d Noise Options  
2. ~~Patch The 0 X Chunk Bug~~ FIXED
3. Add A Feature Loader That Would Allow For Custom Structures To Spawn On The Terrain
4. Add Decoration To The Terrain
5. Add Cell Noise
6. Add OpenSimplex 2d And 3d Noise
7. Allow For Placement Customizations
8. Make Faster (Dont Know If I Can This Is The 8th Version Of The Script And Its The Fastest By Far)
9. Add Config Options So You Dont Have To Retype Them Every Time 
10. Offical Java Support (Shouldnt Be Hard)
