# Auto-CTM
Auto CTM is a python script that can create custom terrain with perlin noise right now this is just for fun and has issues 
# Needed
A copy of minecraft bedrock edition is needed (could be converted to java by changing a few lines but no support will be given for java)
python 3.7 MINIMUM recommended is python 3.10
# Setup
1. Download the .py file from thr release tab
2. Install with pip perlin-noise and amulet with `pip install perlin-noise` and `pip install amulet-core`
3. Read Down
# Using
1. Launch The Script And Paste In Your World Location It Will Look Something like `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\minecraftWorlds\WORLDID`
2. Give the script a scale ie 128,256,512,1024,2048,4096,8192 and so on
3. Give it a base Octave (1 too 2 is recomended for 128 or 256)
4. Leave the world if you are in it
5. If any errors show up just wait 
6. Once done load world
# Issues
1. ITS TAKING TO LONG  
  If its taking to long for your liking change the scale 
2. The terrarin has an issue on the 0 X of each chunk  
  This is a known issue and i am trying to fix it (If you know python 3 feel free to help)
3. ALL MY WORLD IS GONE  
  This script replaces chunks in your world so make a new one or risk loosing your world
4. My world wont load  
  Sometimes this script will error and break your world
